### Yuhao Chang

Hi! My name is Yuhao Chang, and I am currently a first-year Master's student in Biostatistics at the Mailman School of Public Health. I completed my undergraduate studies in marine science, and transitioning to biostatistics has been a significant shift for me, one that I am thoroughly enjoying. In my free time, I enjoy city walking and exploring bakery shops.
