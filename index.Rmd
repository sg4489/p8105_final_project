### Welcome

<div style="background-image: url('background.png'); background-size: cover; padding: 30px; border-radius: 10px; text-align: center; color: white;">
<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Exploring Mortality Trends: 2018–2023</p>
<p style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">
This project examines mortality trends in the United States from 2018 to 2023, focusing on the systemic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2023). By examining temporal patterns, geographic variations, and interactions between COVID-19 and other diseases, we aim to uncover insights that can aid public health interventions and improve resource allocation during health crises.

### Main Research Questions

- What are the most common causes of death in the United States, and how do they vary across time and space from 2018 to 2023?  
- How has the COVID-19 pandemic influenced mortality rates, both directly and indirectly, across different causes of death?  
- Are there geographic disparities in mortality rates, and how do these relate to healthcare resource availability and socio-economic factors?  
- What are the seasonal patterns in mortality, and how do they change during health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic?

### About the Data

Our analysis draws on mortality data from two primary sources:  
1. The **National Center for Health Statistics: Weekly Provisional Counts of Deaths by State and Select Causes, 2020–2023** ([data.cdc.gov](https://data.cdc.gov/d/muzy-jte6)).  
2. The **Provisional Mortality Statistics, 2018 through Last Week Request** ([wonder.cdc.gov](https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D176)).

These datasets provide detailed information on deaths categorized by ICD-10 chapters and specific causes across the United States. Our data preparation included cleaning, standardizing column names, and handling suppressed values (counts <10). Time-series trends, geographic disparities, and correlations with chronic conditions were analyzed to uncover patterns and inform public health strategies.
