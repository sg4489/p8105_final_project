### The tentative project title

Analyzing Trends and Patterns in Mortality Data: A Study on Causes of
Death Across U.S. States from 2020 to 2023

### The anticipated data sources

The primary data source will be the National Center for Health
Statistics: Weekly Provisional Counts of Deaths by State and Select
Causes, 2020-2023. Available from <https://data.cdc.gov/d/muzy-jte6>.

### The motivation and planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges for this project

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a deeper
understanding of mortality trends to improve public health planning and
response. By analyzing the “Weekly Provisional Counts of Deaths by State
and Select Causes” dataset for 2020-2023, we aim to identify trends in
various causes of death, including the direct and indirect impacts of
COVID-19.

Our goals are threefold: First, to uncover seasonal and geographic
variations in mortality, aiding in effective resource allocation and
public health interventions. Second, to explore healthcare disparities
across states and diseases, highlighting unequal access to care. Third,
to analyze COVID-19-specific data to understand how the pandemic
affected mortality from both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 causes.

The analysis will generate insights into changing mortality patterns and
inform evidence-based public health strategies.

### The intended final products

We will create a webpage including an interactive dashboard (if time
permits) that allows users to explore the data by year, state, and cause
of death, a detailed report with data analysis and visualizations
highlighting significant findings in mortality trends. And we will
present our outcomes in a video.

### The planned timeline

*Week 1*: Data preprocessing and initial exploratory data analysis
(EDA).  
*Week 2*: Time series and geospatial analysis.  
*Week 3*: Develop visualizations and finalize analysis.  
*Week 4*: Complete the webpage and compile final report.  
*Week 5* : Make the video, prepare presentation and finalize all
deliverables.
