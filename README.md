### The analysis（Nov. 20th）

#### General Analysis 

1. Explore the trends in the number of deaths across the United States (including at least all-cause and natural-cause deaths).  
2. Create general death proportion visualizations (including a pie chart and a stacked bar chart).  

3. Explore the changes in COVID-19 deaths (underlying and multiple) over time.  
4. Create a 3-panel heatmap to examine the correlation between causes of death for each year.

#### Specific Analysis

1. Perform a time series analysis: create a 4-panel line chart (or other suitable visualization) to explore how the number of deaths changes over time across different regions.  

2. Conduct a geographical exploration: create violin plots within each region to compare the differences in death counts between states. The comparison should ultimately include four regions.

3. Conduct a systemic-level analysis: explore the distribution of deaths by different systems (e.g., respiratory, cardiovascular) across various regions.
