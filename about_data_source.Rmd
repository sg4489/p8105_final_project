Our project includes two datasets. 

1. <h4>[**Weekly Provisional Counts of Deaths by State and Select Causes, 2020â€“2023**](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Weekly-Provisional-Counts-of-Deaths-by-State-and-S/muzy-jte6/about_data)</h4>  

This dataset (10,476 rows and 35 columns) provides weekly counts of deaths categorized by cause, week, and geographic location.  

*Date Range*: Weekly data spanning from 2020 to 2023.  

*Geographic Scope*: Includes data at the state level, as well as an aggregated entry for the entire United States.  

*Key Variables*:  
  * Date Information: Includes variables such as Data As Of, Week Ending Date, MMWR Year, and MMWR Week.  
  * Mortality Data: Includes counts for "All Cause", "Natural Cause", and specific causes like:   
      * Specific causes like:  
      * Septicemia (A40-A41)  
      * Malignant neoplasms (C00-C97)  
      * Diabetes mellitus (E10-E14)  
      * Alzheimer disease (G30)   
      * Influenza and pneumonia (J09-J18)  
      * Chronic lower respiratory diseases (J40-J47)  
      * COVID-19 (U071) as both a multiple and underlying cause of death.  
      * Flags: Columns with prefixes like flag_ indicate potential data quality issues for specific causes.  
      
Privacy Note: To ensure privacy, cells with counts below 10 have been suppressed and appear as blank. For further analysis, we will generate random whole numbers between 1 and 10 to replace these suppressed values.  

2.  <h4>[**Provisional Mortality Statistics, 2018 through Last Week**](https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D176)</h4>   

This dataset contains provisional mortality data grouped by geographic, temporal, and cause-of-death classifications, providing comprehensive insights into population-level mortality trends. It includes 6087 rows and 13 columns.  

*Date Range*: Annual data from 2018 to 2023.  

*Geographic Scope*:   
  Census Region (e.g., Northeast).  
  Residence State (e.g., Connecticut).  

*Key Variables*:  
    * icd_chapter: Cause of death categorized by ICD chapter (e.g., "Neoplasms," "Certain infectious and parasitic diseases").  
    * icd_code: ICD codes corresponding to each chapter.  
    * deaths_count: Total number of deaths for the specific cause and year.  
    * pop: Population count for the respective state and year.  
    * year: Year of observation.  
    
Privacy Note: No suppressed data is observed, as all counts in the deaths_count variable appear to be above privacy thresholds.
